== The Rumr project

This is a project I'm working on.
I'm very new to Rail (and to programming in general for that matter), and it's reflected in the structure of my code...

BUT, this is a pretty cool project, the app I have in mind shouldn't be too hard to build (for someone who has experience), and it would be usefull to MANY.

It's called Rumr, and it basically would allow you to stay up to date on pretty much any subject you're interested in.

If you want to know more about the concept, and help me bring it to life, contact me at <a href="mailto:mikaeltheim@gmail.com">mikaeltheim@gmail.com</a>.
